# Parallelising Boids with OpenMP
This repo contains the code for the mid term assignment of the Parallel Programming for Machine Learning course.

## Abstract
This project implements an efficient, parallel simula-
tion of the “Boids” flocking model using
OpenMP to achieve significant performance speedup in
agent-based spatial interactions.
